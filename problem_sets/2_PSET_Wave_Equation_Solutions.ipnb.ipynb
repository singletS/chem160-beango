    "In the pencasts on the wave equation we saw that the analytical solution to the wave equation that describes a 1-D string can be obtained by the 'separation of variables' technique.  The solution is given in the general form: \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Recall that $x$ is position, $t$ is time.  In the case of a string, $L$ is the length of the string and $c$ is the velocity of sound on the string.  Finally, $n$ is an integer that comes from satisfying the boundary conditions\n",

    "In lectures 3 and 4, we discuss the wavefunction that completely describes the state of the quantum system. The wavefunctions formally live in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. However we cannot represent an infinite space on a computer and we must always restrict ourselves to finite representations. A wavefunction, like many other function, can be expanded using a complete basis set, e.g. the sine basis. In this exercise, we will explore a commonly used basis set known as the *Sinc basis set*. (Note Sinc is not Sine!) A sinc function (as you will plot) is a realization of a delta function. This basis is defined on a grid, meaning that each basis is \"centered\" on a point in space. In other words, each basis function has a significant amplitude only around a certain grid point. Below you will see an example of a localized basis set of gaussian functions:"

    "For this exercise you will have to code by following the guidelines below. But don't panic! You already know everything you need to know to do this. (Don't forget to think through the physics behind the formalism!) \n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps for exercise 4: \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create a grid of 25 points in the range(0,10) to define the basis \n",
    "**Tip**: use the function np.linspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Define your sinc basis set following the formulas shown above. You are free to do it in any way you might think of. One posibility is creating a function that returns one basis set, or you might generate all the basis set and store them.\n",
    "**Tip**: The sinc function is prebuilt in numpy. Check the documentation: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.sinc.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generate 2 plots: 1) A plot showing all your basis sets and 2) a plot zooming into one of the basis sets so you can appreciate the features of the sinc function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Verify the *orthonormality* of the sinc basis by using numerical integration. Pick two random basis to make the orthogonality test. \n",
    "**Tip**: Check demo 2. **Note**: The expected results are approximated because of the numerical approach taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decompose the sine wave (see above) using your sinc basis set. Print the coefficients and make a plot comparing the original sine wave and the sine wave recreated from your decomposition .\n",
    "**Tip**: it's quite similar to what you already did for exercise 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Good luck!\n"
