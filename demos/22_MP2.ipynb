    "From lecture, we saw that the second order correction to the energy within perturbation theory is given by:\n",

    "The above general expression can be made specific for a restricted closed-shell system.\n",
    "With the Hartree-Fock 0$^{th}$ order wave function, we get the following 2nd-order energy correction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E^{(2)} = \\sum_{i j a b} \\langle \\psi_i(r_1) \\psi_j(r_2) | \\frac{1}{r_{12}} | \\psi_a(r_1) \\psi_b(r_2) \\rangle \\frac{2 \\langle \\psi_a(r_1) \\psi_b(r_2) | \\frac{1}{r_{12}} | \\psi_i(r_1) \\psi_j(r_2) \\rangle - \\langle \\psi_a(r_1) \\psi_b(r_2) | \\frac{1}{r_{12}} | \\psi_j(r_1) \\psi_i(r_2) \\rangle}{\\epsilon_i + \\epsilon_j - \\epsilon_a - \\epsilon_b},$$\n",

    "This is what we will implement today. To start, we first grab the basis functions and integrals in the atomic orbital basis from PyQuante. Next, we get the relevant molecular information for the orbital (namely, number of occupied and virtual orbitals). We'll use the fact that the number of virtual orbitals is equal to the total number of orbitals in our basis minus the closed ones. Finally, we will transform atomic orbitals to molecular orbitals.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all the pre-requisite work done, we can actually write the loops that perform the sum. We'll start by initializing the energy as zero. From there, we'll loop through all the occupied orbitals, a and b, and all the unoccupied orbitals, i and j, and add each contribution to the energy given by the formula up above."
